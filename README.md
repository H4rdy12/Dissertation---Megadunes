# Dissertation: Antarctic Megadunes
These scripts illustarte the code used to investigate Antarcticas megadunes. Megadunes are a unique wave landfrom expression formed by wind laid snow deposits.

## REMA

### Extract elevation data from line shape file off tif.ipynb
code based from: https://portailsig.org/content/python-utilisation-des-couches-vectorielles-et-matricielles-dans-une-perspective-geologique-.html .

These REMA extracted elevations from a flightpath aligned with various altimeter satellite products to assess how well REMA accurately represents megadune features. The altimeter products used were ICESat-2, CryoSat-2 and Sentinnel-3.

### Calculate wave landform expression charachteristics
Calculating: amplitude, wavelength, length and frequency.
