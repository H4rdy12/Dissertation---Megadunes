# Dissertation: Antarctic Megadunes
These scripts illustarte the code used to investigate Antarcticas megadunes. Megadunes are a unique wave landfrom expression formed by wind laid snow deposits. 

## REMA

### Extracting REMA elevation alonga specific flightpath
code based from: https://portailsig.org/content/python-utilisation-des-couches-vectorielles-et-matricielles-dans-une-perspective-geologique-.html .

These REMA extracted elevations from a flightpath aligned with various altimeter satellite products to assess how well REMA accurately represents megadune features. The altimeter products used were ICESat-2, CryoSat-2 and Sentinnel-3.
